      <h1>R Naming Conventions</h1>
      <section>
        <p>R programming language follows its own set of naming conventions. Here are the key points:</p>
        <h3>Variables and Functions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use lowercase letters for variable names.</li>
          <li>Separate words with underscores or use camelCase.</li>
          <li>Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.</li>
          <li>Functions should have descriptive names that indicate their purpose.</li>
          <li>Avoid using reserved words as variable names.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Constants</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Constants are not explicitly defined in R, but conventionally use uppercase letters for variables that are not intended to be modified.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Classes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>R uses S3 and S4 class systems for object-oriented programming.</li>
          <li>Class names should be meaningful and follow the same conventions as variable names.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Packages</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Package names should be descriptive and lowercase.</li>
          <li>Avoid using names that conflict with existing R packages.</li>
        </ul>
