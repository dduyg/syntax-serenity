      <h1>Naming Conventions</h1>
      <section>
        <p>Naming conventions are guidelines for choosing meaningful and consistent names for variables, functions, classes, and other elements in your code. They help keep your code organized and readable, making it easier for you and others to understand and work with. Let's start with universal guidelines that should be followed regardless of the programming language being used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Descriptive and Meaningful Names:</strong> Use meaningful names that convey the purpose of the variable or function. Avoid single-letter names unless they are used for very short-lived variables like loop counters.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Naming Conflicts:</strong> Ensure that your names don't conflict with keywords or reserved words in your programming language.</li>
          <li><strong>Use nouns for variables and classes:</strong> Variables and class names should typically represent nouns or noun phrases that describe the entity they represent.</li>
          <li><strong>Use verbs for function and method names:</strong> Function and method names should represent actions or operations. They should typically start with a verb or verb phrase that describes what the function does.</li>
          <li><strong>Use meaningful prefixes or suffixes:</strong> Sometimes, adding prefixes like <code>is_</code> or <code>has_</code> can make boolean variables clearer. Similarly, suffixes like <code>List</code>, <code>Map</code>, or <code>Collection</code> can clarify the type of a variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Singular Names for Single Objects:</strong> Use singular names for variables representing single instances and plural names for collections.</li>
          <li><strong>Consider readability over brevity:</strong> While shorter names might seem more concise, prioritize readability over brevity. A slightly longer, descriptive name is preferable if it makes the code more understandable.</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid Hungarian Notation:</strong> Hungarian notation, where variable names include type information (e.g., <code>strName</code>, <code>intCount</code>), is generally discouraged in modern programming languages. With strongly typed languages and modern IDEs, this practice is unnecessary and can make code harder to read.</li>
          <li><strong>Be mindful of scope:</strong> Use names that reflect the scope of the variable or function. For example, use descriptive names for global variables and more concise names for local variables.</li>
          <li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Maintain consistency in naming across your codebase. If you start with CamelCase or snake_case, stick with it throughout your project.</li>
          <li><strong>Use domain-specific terminology:</strong> If you're working within a specific domain or framework, use terminology consistent with that domain. It makes your code more understandable to domain experts.</li>
        </ul>
